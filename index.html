  <h2> Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
<div class="concept">
  <div class="concept-title">
 Navigating and Viewing The Internet 
  </div>
     <p>
  Understanding that the internet is really a web of computers interacting with each other thru commands and computer language. Anytime a person wants to "<em>go somewhere</em>" on the internet they have to type in an address on their browser like www. udacity.com and the computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. <a href="https://www.udacity.com"> Udacity </a> is where you end up. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

HTML
  </div>
  <p>
  HTML stands for <em><b>Hypertext Markup Language.</b></em> HTML documents make up most of what we see on the internet. It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets. Here is an example <img src="http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#/media/File:HTML_logo.png" alt="HTML PIC"> </p>

Tags and Elements
    </div>
<p>
  HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. For an example <br> is an empty element without a closing tag.

 Inline vs Block Elements
   </div>
   <p>
   HTML elements are either <span class="bold">inline</span> or  <span class="bold">block</span>.While block elements do form a box around their content, the difference between block and inline elements is that block elements are displayed with a line break, meaning more than one block element cannot be on the same horizontal line unless a different display is used, and inline elements are displayed without a line break, meaning more than one inline element can be on the same horizontal line. Some examples of inline elements are : a, span, br, img, and strong. Some box elements are: p, div, and form.

       HTML elements are either <span class="bold">inline</span> 
          or <span class="bold">block</span>. Block elements form 
          an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

      The "tree-like structure" of HTML
        </p>
    </div>
       <p>
      When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page. The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on... 
      </p>
      <p> 
      In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...

          The relationship between indented HTML and boxes
            </div>
              When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of 
          changing indentations going up and down the left side 
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the 
          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

      Text Editors (for programming)
        </p>
    </div>
      When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag. Like <em>sractchpad.ios</em> editor.

  <h2> Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to an HTML Structure</h2>

      CSS
        </p>
        </div>
           CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.

      Benefits of Style Sheet
        </p>
        </div>
         <p>
           Avoiding <b>repetition</b> creates cleaner code which may then become 'reuseable'. It supports "work smarter, not harder".

          Creating <b>consistency:</b> Using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to standardize the look of web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          To create a sytle structure within the HTML one would do something like this:</p>
        Within the header, create a link as shown here:  
        <p> Using opening and closing "style" tags", Be sure to define your class and place <br>
          your element details between left and right braces ({}). </p>            
  </div>
